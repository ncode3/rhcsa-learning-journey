# RHCSA Learning Journey

My path from Microsoft Solution Architect to Infrastructure Engineer.

## Why This Exists

After 8 years as a Microsoft Solution Architect (Data/AI), I realized I'd been designing cloud solutions without understanding the infrastructure underneath. This repo documents my journey learning Linux, virtualization, and bare metal infrastructure from first principles.

## The Journey

- **Week 0-2**: RHCSA fundamentals with Dave (Red Hat SA mentor)
- **Week 3-8**: Infrastructure deep dive (monitoring, AI inference, operations)
- **Week 9-16**: Heart Pattern migration from AWS (proof of concept)
- **Week 17+**: African AI infrastructure (the bigger vision)

## What I'm Learning

### Infrastructure Fundamentals
- Resource planning (CPU, memory, storage)
- Overcommitment strategies (how clouds make money)
- Caching architectures (the secret to performance)
- Network isolation (VLANs, security)
- Platform delivery (making infrastructure usable)

### Production Operations
- Monitoring & observability (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Troubleshooting (CPU exhaustion, OOM killer, swap thrashing)
- Automation (Ansible, bash, Python)
- AI inference workloads (Ollama, tool calling, agentic AI)

### The Gap I'm Filling
AI tools (Cursor, v0, Bolt) taught me to BUILD fast.
But they didn't teach infrastructure, caching, or optimization.
That's what I'm fixing.

## Structure

- `/notes` - Daily learning notes
- `/practice` - Command exercises
- `/weekly-log` - Week-by-week progress
- `/study-plan` - RHCSA exam prep
- `/resources` - Useful links and references

## Current Status

‚úÖ Week 0: Foundation (RHEL environment, cluster setup)
‚úÖ Week 1: OpenShift deployment on VMware
üéØ Week 2: Monitoring & AI inference
‚è≥ Weeks 3-8: Continued fundamentals
‚è≥ Weeks 9-16: Heart Pattern migration
